If the file with the code does not display properly, one solution is to download it and open with the JupyterLab or other coding environment.

Another option is to review the code using nbviewer (however it won't include the 3D interactive plots): https://nbviewer.org/github/Untamevo/Projects/blob/main/Movies%20in%20Statistical%20Terms/MST_project.ipynb
